# Flask Application Base
This repository serves as a basic framework upon which more complicated Flask applications may be built.  I've included a basic uWSGI and Docker setup as well.

Users may simply modify the templates, modules, and so forth within the `Application/` directory, and then build/deploy a Docker container in a fairly straightforward way.
